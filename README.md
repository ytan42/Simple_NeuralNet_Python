# Simple_NeuralNet_Python
Author: ytan42

A simple fully connected neural network with 4 layers - 1 input, 2 hidden and 1 output layers for regression purpose.

The model has two hidden layers but can be extended for more layers. The number of neurons for each hidden layer can be changed. The activation function for the two hidden layers is tanh. Since the model is for regression, the activation function for the output layer is just a linear combination of input.
